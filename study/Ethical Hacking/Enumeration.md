- Enumeration revolves around perusing leads, and exploring all possible angles of attack
- A possible flow is something like: 
	- Using [[Useful Linux Commands Explained#nmap |nmap]] to find exploitable ports 
	- Then [[Hacking Tools#^b7c0a7|nikto]] to identify possible weaknesses in web applications 
	- Followed by a [[Hacking Tools#^b7c0a7|dirbuster]] scan with a wordlist file on one of the exploitable ports
- [[Hacking Tools#^4f8b18|smbclient]] is great for trying to enumerate when an SMB port is discovered
- SSH
	- The reason to attempt SSH enumeration despite it being so secure is that you may be shown a banner telling you the SSH version and who made it, which info that can be further enumerated
	- For older machines when you try to ssh you may be told no matching key exchange method is found
		- In this case, try `ssh 192.168.57.4 -oKexAlgorithms=+[the machine's offer]` as the machine will be offering a specific exchange method
		- You can then follow this up with `ssh 192.168.57.4 -oKexAlgorithms=+[the machine's offer] -c [offered cipher]` when you get a 2nd error telling you that no matching cipher was found
