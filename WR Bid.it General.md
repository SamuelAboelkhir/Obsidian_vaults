# General notes
- Car owner's car must have a registered VIN number
- Car dealer must be certified with the Quebec authorities that he can buy and sell cars
- We have 4 elements
	- Consumer
	- Dealers
	- Platform
	- Admin
- A user must fill the appropriate form to get an account, and an admin must validate him
	- The user can browse the platform while waiting, but can't use it
- Reserve price is the price the consumer wants to sell at
	- Either we pass the reserve: Automatic sale
	- We're very far: Negotiation and potential new auction
	- We're very close: Admin allows consumer and dealer discuss to reach a middle ground
- By default consumers and dealers will not see each other's contact details
- Buy now is an auto buy price that bypasses the auction and allows you to immediately buy the car at a higher price set by the consumer
