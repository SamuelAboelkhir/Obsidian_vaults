- Buffer overflow is based around sending too much data to a program in order to try and overflow its memory buffer and spill into the following memory buffer
- The goal is to reach a buffer called the EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer) which is a pointer or return address.
- We can use this address by pointing towards the direction that we want (malicious code) to gain reverse shell, and access to the target.

# Steps
1. Spiking ^3a5df5
	1. [[Spiking]]
	2. A method that finds a vulnerable part of a program
	3. Meant for reconnaissance and discovery
2. Fuzzing
	1. Sending a bunch of characters to a program to see if we can break it
3. Finding the Offset
	1. If we can break it we want to know when/where we can break it
4. Overwriting the EIP
	1. We use the Offset to overwrite the EIP
5. Finding Bad Characters
	1. House clean up
6. Finding the Right Module
	1. Also house cleaning
	2. Meant for finding the execution vector or bypassing protection
7. Generating Shellcode
	1. Helps us get the [[Exploitation#Netcat Reverse Shell|reverse shell]]
8. Achieving code execution
