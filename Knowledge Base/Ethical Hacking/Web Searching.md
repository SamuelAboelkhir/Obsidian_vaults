### Google
- [Google Searching Syntax](https://developers.google.com/code-search/reference) Google-fu is good. Use advanced searching syntax on a domain and try different searching terms, filetypes, sites, etc. in order to see what extra info you can find.

### Linkdin
- Investigating an organization on social media like linkdin can lead you to photos by the org or employees with important data, such as employee badges
- Try not to look at employee profiles from you actual profile as they will get notified that you looked at their profiles
