# The unnamed science project
## The dream
- This project is going to be a reflection of my education, of everything I know
- It will combine
	- Biology
	- Chemistry
	- Data sciences
	- Bioinformatics
	- Medical sciences
	- Full stack development
	- Low level concepts
	- High level concepts
	- Polyglot architecture
- And yet, I have no idea what I'm even building, I just know that I want to build it
- I expect this project to live with me for a quite a while
## The stack
- As of 03-05-2026
	- Go 1.26.2
	- R 4.5.3
	- RStudio
```R

## Current execution
- The project currently is a repl CLI tool that utilizes Go as an HTTP client querying PubChem's REST API to fetch chemical data
- The core function so far is a query builder that takes user input and assembles it into a valid PubChem URL where the data is fetched from
- The app also features 
	- A caching system that make use of Go's concurrency
	- A generic API client (I call it the postman) that can fetch any generic data
	- Wrapper functions around the generic API client that properly type the data
	- A command interface that any new command must satisfy
	- A commands struct that stores a map of all the available commands
## Future ideas
- Add a postgres database that optionally stores data based on user input
- A dockerized R server in a small private network with the main Go system for that handles data analytics
- Various scientific tools
- A clients interface that allows for extending the app with clients for connecting with different data sources
- A generic query builder, and dedicated query builders for very specific data sources (like PubChem)
- Proper database connection handling (retry logic, disconnection logic)
- Request rate limiting, as to not accidentally crash any API
