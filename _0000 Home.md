[[_0002 Work MOC]]
[[_0003 Personal MOC]]
# Methodology
- Based on Claude, the methodologies implemented in the making of this knowledge base are 
#### **1. Zettelkasten Principles:**
`✅ Atomic notes (one concept per note) ✅ Unique identifiers (your naming system) ✅ Linking over hierarchy (though you use both) ✅ Emergent structure (organic clustering)`

### **2. PARA-Adjacent:**
`✅ Projects (your assessment work) ✅ Areas (ongoing domains like EH, Web Security) ✅ Resources (reference materials) ✅ Clear boundaries between types`

### **3. Maps of Content (MOC):**
`✅ Hub notes that organize related concepts ✅ Multiple MOCs for different domains ✅ MOCs that link to other MOCs`
