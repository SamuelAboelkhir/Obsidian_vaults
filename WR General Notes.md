- Assumption 1: 
	- React is not needed excel is enough
	- We may need to fix the DB
	- We may need to only work with websphere
- Assumption 2:
	- We don't need to touch the DB
	- We only need to work with websphere's retrieved data
	- We need to optimize the React frontend
- Assumption 3:
	- Hybrid approach
	- We need to fix the DB
	- We need to work on websphere
	- We need to optimize React

- Why is onboarding hard?
	- IBM i is hard
	- Data scatter
	- The excel is using a schema made by the operators that only they know

# Meeting notes

- ROI of db analysis? : S
- giving them immediate value thru optimization : N
- worst case scenario: start over
- pros of refactoring existing interface: time
- cons of refactoring: technical debt inheritance
- Why even need an interface?
- Db optimization is an asset/investment for the future

db2 catalog tcpip node node_name remote dashDB_IP_address server port

how do I use this command to connect with the DB2 server hosted on my client's AS400?

I tried and got SQL10007N Message "-1390" could not be retrieved. Reason code: "3".
