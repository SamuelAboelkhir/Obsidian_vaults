2. Take a look at the DB and diagnose it
3. Look for inconsistencies and define/plan what needs to be fixed and how
4. Find operational problems as we're studying the software
5. Prepare a report to present the findings

### Digital transformation program
- Multi project program

### Shadow system
1. An excel sheet is housing all their data
2. Operators, dispatchers, etc. can go on that excel sheet to go all the data they need
3. An interface on top of AS400 was attempted and failed (the employees were not consulted before the interface was made)
4. It's hard to onboard people on the excel sheet

### Bottom line
- Increase efficiency and revenue for the client
