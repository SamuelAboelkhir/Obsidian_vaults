- Devops needs to transfer the app files from the local device to websphere
- The devops pipline is failing though
- Currently transferring the EAR file to websphere is manual
- They want to migrate from gitlab to azure
- VAWarehouse has a frontend and backend projects
- Backend is built in nodeJs
- Frontend is react
- Websphere is able to pass the development code to production
- They use the same IP (10.30.1.134) with different ports
- They already have an azure devops account
- There are features in gitlab they can't access as its limited to innovations
- They're copying their gitlab repo to another gitlab owned by them and not innovations
- There is also a docker image
- We're suggesting to migrate from innovation's gitlab to another VA gitlab instead of going directly to azure devops for hosting the webapp
- We will migrate from innovation's gitlab to our own, do test, then back to their gitlab, and if they want then to azure
